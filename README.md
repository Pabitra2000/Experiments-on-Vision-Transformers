# Experiments-on-Vision-Transformers
Implementation of Vision Transformer based image classifier and some experiments on feature learning by vision transformers on different datasets 

In the ViT test run file, we tested Vision Transformer based MLP.

In the ViT_SVHN_train we trained our ViT model on SVHN dataset and tested it on USPS and in the MNIST dataset, we also measure our proposed KL divergence for the two datasets and compare how does the increase in divergence changes the accuracy when trained on one domain and tested on the other.
